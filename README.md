# Project Title : Stock Performance Analysis Dashboard

**1. Project Overview**

This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI Dashboard for analyzing historical stock performance.The primary goal is to transform raw, time-series stock data into an intuitive visual story, enabling users to quickly grasp key trends, volatility, and trading activity for informed decision-making.

**2. Time Series Analysis**

A line chart visualizing the stock's Closing Price over time, allowing users to identify long-term trends, growth patterns, and significant price movements.

**3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

* Current Price (or price at the selected date range).

* Total Volume of shares traded.

* Price Change and percentage gain/loss over the selected period.

* Daily Price Range & Volatility:

A visualization (likely a bar or candlestick chart) showing the High, Low, Open, and Close prices for each day. This helps in assessing daily volatility and market sentiment.

Interactive Year Filter:

As seen in the screenshot, a slicer allows users to filter the entire dashboard by Year. This enables focused analysis on specific periods, such as comparing performance between 2017, 2018, 2019, etc.

Data-driven Insights:

The dashboard allows users to interact with the charts to drill down into specific dates and instantly see the corresponding OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) values and volume, facilitating quick, granular analysis.
