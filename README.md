**Project Title: Power BI Stock Analysis Dashboard**

**1. Project Overview**

This project is an interactive Power BI Stock Analysis Dashboard created using a dataset containing daily stock price information (Open, Close, High, Low) for multiple companies such as Amazon, Apple & IBM.
The purpose of this dashboard is to help users analyze stock performance trends, compare different companies, study quarter-wise patterns & track the daily opening prices with interactive slicers for Year, Quarter & Stock Name.

**2. KPIs**

* Max High – The highest recorded “High” price
* Min High – The lowest recorded “High” price
* Max Low – The highest recorded “Low” price
* Min Low – The lowest recorded “Low” price

**3. Date-wise Stock Trend (Open Price)**

* Understanding daily movement
* Identifying sudden spikes or drops
* Tracking long-term stock trends
* Comparing behavior across different time periods

**4. Quarter-wise Analysis**

  **Qtr Wise Avg Close**
* Displays average closing price for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
* Helps identify which quarter performed better
* Shows seasonal patterns or stock volatility

  **Qtr Wise Avg Open**
* Shows average opening price per quarter
* Makes it easy to compare quarter-on-quarter performance

5. Detailed Date & Open Price Table

A scrollable table displays:

Date

Total / Sum of Open Price

This allows analysts to quickly review raw stock price values alongside summarized visuals.
A grand total is also included at the bottom.

6. Interactive Filters (Slicers)

The dashboard includes dynamic slicers:

Year (2017, 2018)

Quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

Stock Name (Amazon, Apple, IBM)

These filters allow users to focus on specific time ranges or compare companies side-by-side.

7. Project Purpose

This dashboard provides actionable insights such as:

Which stock showed the highest volatility?

Which quarter performed best in terms of Open/Close prices?
